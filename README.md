# This Vanilla JS app, imitating the React library, the SPA design.
This is a digital watch that has a "stop timer" and also "alarm" as a feature.
It is cumbersome to track/control the state change of an app, more reason I appreciate the React Js.
Some of the states I forgot to reset or re-render. It was quite a challenge.
It is true any app can be developed in plain javascript but it is just an unnecessary hassle.

Hey, no complaints! For every struggle, there is something you get for your arsenal
